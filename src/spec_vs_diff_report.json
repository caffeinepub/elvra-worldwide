  "summary": "The diff does not show evidence that the four fallback sample images under `/assets/generated/sample1–sample4.dim_1200x800.jpg` were actually replaced, nor any changes to the frontend sample-slot hook/selector wiring. It also includes several changes that were not requested (a deploy marker file, project state metadata updates, and backend code modifications).",

      "reason": "The diff summary does not show any modifications/additions to the actual image files under `frontend/public/assets/generated/` (or equivalent) and does not show any changes to `frontend/src/hooks/useProductBannerSamples.ts` or `frontend/src/components/ProductSampleSelector.tsx` confirming the fallback URLs now point to replaced assets.
