  "summary": "Frontend implements a two-step Internet Identity sign-up flow with Full Name + Email form, validation, and dashboard navigation. A new BasicProfile type and a frontend hook calling `actor.saveBasicProfile` were added. However, the diff summary truncation prevents confirming that the backend actually implements `saveBasicProfile` and that it persists into the existing `userProfiles` map without breaking existing profile methods. Additionally, a summary file describes multiple unrelated UI/route changes not requested.",
