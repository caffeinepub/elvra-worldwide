    "Project name: Elvra Worldwide.",
    "UI theme: premium, luxury, clean; black and gold color palette; international/professional design.",
    "Site structure includes public marketing pages plus auth and a user dashboard.",
    "Payments: include a section that references Stripe and PayPal (provider mentions).",
    "Contact page UX: use direct contact actions (mailto + WhatsApp deep link) with Framer Motion hover animations in a black-and-gold premium card layout.",
    "Live chat: integrate Tidio by including the provided async script tag site-wide (e.g., in the main HTML/template).",
    "Potential backend shift/addition: use Supabase via @supabase/supabase-js (createClient with SUPABASE_URL + ANON_KEY) for data persistence.",
